# Contribute Food Images
We're expanding our dataset and need diverse, high-quality images of food items. Here's how you can help:

What We're Looking For:

Clear images of individual food items ( bread, rice and stew, yam, egusi, akara, moi moi).

Photos taken in natural lighting without filters.

Images that focus on the food item, minimizing background distractions.

How to Submit:

Fork this repository.

Create a new folder under dataset/contributions/ named after the food category (e.g., bread, akara).

Add your images to the appropriate folder.

Commit your changes with a descriptive message.

Open a pull request with the title: Add [number] [food category] images.

Note: Ensure you have the rights to share these images and that they don't contain identifiable personal information.
